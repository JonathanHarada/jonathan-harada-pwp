<!--Content regarding navbar-->
<section>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Navbar</h2>
             <p>I would like the navbar to be sticky so that navigation is quick and easy no matter what you're looking at.
                It's also important for me to have the CONTACT ME button stand out from the rest and be a central point of each page.
                I would like to send a message to potential employers that it is easy to reach me, and if they have questions to please try.
                 Otherwise it's a typical navbar with easy navigation around the page and links to Git/LinkedIn.

<!--Content explanation regarding Head 1-->
<section>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Head 1</h2>
            <p>Head 1 should be a brief introduction of myself to a potential employer. It should state my name, the type of work that I currently have or that I'm currently looking for,
                and have keywords regarding the technologies that I've worked with. I would also like to include a small picture of myself.</p>

<!--Content explanation regarding About Me-->
<section>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>About me is split into two sections. The first section has a slide show of screenshots from websites that I've worked on from the portfolio section.
            Next to the slideshow will be a description of the technologies that I used, and then dive into work experience that I have previously and why that makes me
            a good fit for a team. The goal here is to have a snapshot of technologies I'm comfortable with so that people briefly skimming portfolios don't feel they
            have to click on a separate link. It's also important for me to have the contact button close and stand out again. If the employer feels confident in contacting me
            they should be able to do that quickly and easily.</p>

            <p>The second about me is a quick slideshow of me in my personal life doing normal stuff. (Brainstorming what this looks like still). The goal is to sell myself
            as an investment, and show stability and reliability.</p>

<!--Content explanation regarding Portfolio-->
<section>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>The portfolio section should have at least 3 separate websites that I've built/worked on. If potential employers would like to dive deeper into my work
            past the slide show provided, they have this option. This section should provide the link to the associated website, and then as much description regarding
            my work as necessary. </p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!--Content explanation regarding Contact Me-->
<section>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Contact Me</h2>
            <p>This section is meant to be brief and direct. If an employer would rather call me directly, I would like a phone number displayed. Otherwise there
            are two ways to e-mail me. The overall theme of this portfolio is to ENCOURAGE potential employers to contact me. If somebody not even hiring stumbles
            across this portfolio, I want them to feel inclined to send me an e-mail.</p>
