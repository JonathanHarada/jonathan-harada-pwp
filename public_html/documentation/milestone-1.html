    <h1>Purpose</h1>
    <p>The purpose of my personal website project is to create a customizable virtual resume/portfolio which will demonstrate my knowledge        of front end web development to potential employers. This project should demonstrate high technical ability utilizing Javascript, display a         highly empathetic approach to the UI/UX, and be neat and easy to read for any potential employers. I also intend to make this project easily        customizable, so that future completed projects can be displayed as my coding career continues.</p>
    <h1>Audience</h1>
    <p>The target audience is first and foremost meant to be a professional display for potential employers. This may include:
        Start-up tech companies either locally or nation wide;
        local restaurants and other businesses looking to increase their presence online through advertisement/ordering;
        my networks of friends and family who will view it and may pass it along to a contact;
        and recruiters.
    </p>
    <h1>Goal</h1>
    <p>The primary goal of this personal website project is to obtain full time employment in the web development field. Secondary goal would be to       utilize the project as advertisement of my work in order to obtain short term freelance work.</p>

    <h3>Name: Julie Jacobson</h3>
    <p>Technologies: IPad POS system with Square software, Excel, Macbook pro 2020, MacOS 11.4, safari web browser, I-phone 12, Facebook, Instagram, LinkdIn, and TikTok.</p>
    <p>Proficiency: Good. Julie spends a large portion of her day using technology. While Julie uses technology on a daily basis with her small business selling baked goods, she is not proficient in any programming language and has been unable to have a strong presence on-line.</p>
    <p>Attitudes and Needs: Julie opened her small business 3 years ago and spends a majority of her time working to make it successful. She is very hard working and has sunk countless hours into making the business profitable, but her business has not yet become stable. Julie believes that her lack of an online presence contributes to this. Julie had her brother set up a website with very basic features, including a menu and a link to her e-mail for requests.</p>
