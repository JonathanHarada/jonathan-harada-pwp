    <header>Milestone 1 for Jonathan Harada</header>
<div>
    <h1>Purpose</h1>
    <p>The purpose of my personal website project is to create a customizable virtual resume/portfolio which will demonstrate my knowledge        of front end web development to potential employers. This project should demonstrate technical ability utilizing Javascript, display a         highly empathetic approach to the UI/UX, and be neat and easy to read for any potential employers. I also intend to make this project easily        customizable, so that future completed projects can be displayed as my coding career continues.</p>
    <h1>Audience</h1>
    <p>The target audience is first and foremost meant to be a professional display for potential employers. This may include:
        Local restaurants and other businesses looking to increase their presence on-line hiring a freelance developer; start-up tech companies either locally or nation wide;
        my network of friends and family who will view it and may pass it along to a contact;
        and recruiters.
    </p>
    <h1>Goal</h1>
    <p>The primary goal is to utilize this project as an advertisement of my work developing as well as myself as an employee, in order to obtain freelance work and potentially full time employment.</p>

    <h1 class="page-2">Persona</h1>
    <h1>Name: Julie Jacobson</h1>
    <p><b>Technologies:</b> IPad POS system with Square software, Excel, Macbook pro 2020, MacOS 11.4, safari web browser, I-phone 12, Facebook, Instagram, LinkdIn, and TikTok.</p>
    <p><b>Proficiency</b>: Good. Julie spends a large portion of her day using technology. While Julie uses technology on a daily basis with her small business selling baked goods, she is not proficient in any programming language and her business has been unable to have a strong presence on-line.</p>
    <p><b>Attitudes and Needs:</b> Julie opened her small business 3 years ago and spends a majority of her time working to make it successful. She is very hard working and has sunk countless hours into making the business profitable, but her business has not yet become stable. Julie believes that her lack of an online presence contributes to this. Julie has a limited budget and has decided to utilize LinkdIn to browse portfolio's of web developer freelancers who might be able to negotiate an affordable price. Julie is determined and willing to sort through hundreds of portfolios to find the best fit.</p>
    <p><b>Frustrations:</b> Failure. Slow web sites. Developers who don't display work they've done in the past. Vagueness about pricing. Generic website layouts/lack ability to provide full customization. Too much focus on technical languages that she doesn't understand. Lack of any personal information about the developer. Difficulty finding contact information of developers she does like. Slow responsiveness from developer.</p>
    <p><b>Role:</b> Julie is sorting through portfolios until she finds the perfect fit, sometimes only viewing one for 10 seconds before making a decision. Once she has her freelancer she won't use the portfolio herself. She may pass it along to friends. </p>
    <p><b>User Story:</b> Julie is determined to make her small business successful with a stronger on-line presence, she is sorting through hundreds of portfolios over the next couple of weeks in order to find a developer who fits her needs.</p>
